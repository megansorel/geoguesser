In <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/press-office/Wildlife-Photographer-of-the-Year/first-wildlife-photographer-of-the-year-2020-images-revealed11.html\">announcing the winners</a> on Tuesday, the museum said it had received more than 50,000 submissions from 95 countries.</p> <p>The entries in this year's competition â€” the 57th edition â€” were judged anonymously by a <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/press-office/Wildlife-Photographer-of-the-Year/wildlife-photographer-of-the-year-announces-international-jury-a.html\">panel of international experts</a> for \"originality, narrative, technical excellence and ethical practice.\" </p> <p>\"The two Grand Title winners were selected from 19 category winners that celebrate the captivating beauty of our natural world with rich habitats, enthralling animal behaviour and extraordinary species,\" the museum explained. </p> <p>The newest Wildlife Photographer of the Year is French underwater photographer and biologist Laurent Ballesta, whose first-place image was actually years in the making. </p> <p>It's called <em>Creation</em>, and captures camouflage groupers exiting a milky cloud of eggs and sperm in a biosphere reserve in Fakarava, French Polynesia. The museum said that Laurent and his team returned to the lagoon every year for five years, \"diving day and night so as not to miss the annual spawning that only takes place around the full moon in July.\"</p> <div class=\"bucketwrap image large\" id=\"res1045725058\">\n",

      "<p>In 1964, Lou Reed was turning out trendy pop singles for the budget label Pickwick records. At the same time, Welshman John Cale was playing viola in minimalist composer La Monte Young's musical ensemble. Pickwick thought Reed's novelty dance song \"The Ostrich\" had commercial potential, so together they enlisted members of Young's circle to back him at live promotional gigs, where Cale noticed that Reed was tuning all six of his guitar strings to the same note, an experiment in tonality that resembled the way he was layering and extending notes to create sonic drones. Then, Reed showed him some of the other material he was working on, gritty, confrontational songs that took drug use, sadomasochism, and existential despair as their subject matter.</p> <p>Cale says he admired Reed's abilities but thought his potential was being wasted, so they started collaborating and were soon joined by Reed's college classmate Sterling Morrison on rhythm guitar and Maureen \"Moe\" Tucker on drums. They called themselves the Velvet Underground, their name inspired by a 1963 paperback depicting sexual subcultures.</p> <aside aria-label=\"advertisement\" id=\"ad-backstage-wrap\">\n",

      "</aside> <p>While the band was taking shape, nearby Andy Warhol was expanding his multimedia work and moving specifically into film, pushing the boundaries of form and content. Shortly after opening his first Factory in 1963, Warhol purchased a 16mm Bolex movie camera, which he used to perform hundreds of \"Screen Tests.\" These weren't typical Hollywood auditions, but more experiments in duration, explains film critic Amy Taubin.</p> <p>Back then Taubin was an actress, and one of Warhol's sitters. \"Warhol looked at your face, and then he adjusted one light, and the angle of the camera, and he said 'try not to move, try not to blink,' and then he went away.\"</p> <p>Inside the camera was a single spool of black and white film, which took about three minutes to run to its final length. When Warhol screened the results, he would slow the film down to run at silent speed, 16 frames per second, a third slower than life. Like Reed's \"Ostrich\" tuning and Cale's sonic drones, Warhol's Screen Tests were experiments with time, challenging the conventions of their respective mediums. \"Part of the distance you feel when you look at those films,\" recalls Taubin, \"is the fact that the people are vivid! I mean they're looking right into the camera but they're somehow in a different time zone.\"</p> <div class=\"bucketwrap image large\" id=\"res1045744791\">\n",

      "<p>Because of Warhol's involvement, The Velvet Underground became The Factory's house band. Warhol paid for recording sessions, became a (nominal) producer and leveraged his fame to take the band on the road with The Exploding Plastic Inevitable, a live mixed-media \"happening\" featuring music, strobes and slides. Sometimes films were projected behind and directly onto the band, human \"screens\" who were all dressed in black. Often Factory \"superstars\" Gerard Malanga and Mary Woronov performed a whip dance to accompany the music. The idea was to immerse everyone in the center of all that was happening. \"It was marvelous,\" recalls Cale, \"Jackie Kennedy would be in the audience.\"</p> <div class=\"bucketwrap video youtube-video large\" id=\"res1045775974\">\n",

      "<p>But Warhol's ambitions proved too edgy for the mainstream. Several labels declined to sign the band before MGM eventually said yes to releasing <em>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</em> through its Verve subsidiary, but even so dragged its feet on putting the album out for nearly a year. When the debut was finally released, in 1967, it featured a provocative album cover designed by Warhol: a banana skin sticker that could be peeled back to reveal pink fruit beneath.</p> <p>The content hindered the record's promotion â€“ radio stations refused to play the songs and legal challenges to a photograph on the back forced the record company to recall the album just as it was gaining steam. Sales in the first two years topped off somewhere in the tens of thousands, considered a commercial failure at that time. Nico left for a solo career. Reed fired Warhol and then Cale, then steered the songs toward a decidedly more radio friendly sound, reflected in songs like the aptly titled \"Rock &amp; Roll.\" The Velvet Underground disbanded completely within a few years.</p> <p>Despite its brief run, Brian Eno famously quipped that everyone who heard the Velvet Underground's first album started a band. That's spot-on says filmmaker Todd Haynes, who credits the Velvet Underground for paving the way for glam rock and punk as well as queer and independent filmmaking. \"With all the innovations and extraordinary examples of new ideas that were circulating in rock and roll, R&amp;B and jazz in the '60s, to be able to talk about a kind of instability of how you feel in relation to the world and a desire at times to eliminate yourself, to evacuate, destroy and annul yourself, [before the Velvet Underground] this wasn't being talked about, let alone sadomasochistic, homoerotic scenarios that were pervasive in the music and in the scene.\"</p> <div class=\"bucketwrap video youtube-video large\" id=\"res1045773982\">\n",

      "<p>After making inventive biopics about Karen Carpenter, the glam rock scene and Bob Dylan, <em>The Velvet Underground </em>is Hayne's first music documentary â€“ but it's no more conventional than his other work. In place of the standard \"rockumentary\" tropes, Haynes uses the language of '60s experimental cinema, such as split screen and montage, to tell the story of the Velvet Underground and the time, place, and culture that inspired it.</p> <p>This includes making use of those old Warhol Screen Tests, Haynes explains, \"You get to live through the entirety of these screen tests and watch Lou Reed or John Cale or Maureen Tucker or Sterling Morrison literally existing on film in front of you for that duration, while the neighboring screen is showing clips and images and stills about their life or things you're hearing in the audio.\"</p> <p>In that archival footage, Haynes also spotlights the work of other significant creative catalysts, including filmmakers such as Jack Smith, Jonas Mekas, Marie Menken and Barbara Rubin. However, he's not so much interested in chronicling the past as he is in showing you how the future happened.</p>\n",

      "<p>I had interviewed VivÃ³ a few days earlier in the Colombian border town of AcandÃ­. A divorced father of an adult son and daughter, he worked loading cargo at Havana's international airport but was just scraping by. He had long dreamed of joining relatives in Miami and starting anew but had never before traveled overseas.</p> <p>\"Imagine if you lived in Cuba all your life and never saw any prosperity or progress,\" he said. \"Every Cuban is itching to leave.\"</p> <p>Many Cubans have reached the U.S. by taking homemade rafts across the Florida Straits. But VivÃ³ said he knew several people who had tried it and drowned. That convinced him he'd be better off staying on solid ground.</p> <p>In 2019 he flew to the tiny South American nation of Suriname, one of the few countries issuing tourist visas to Cubans. He saved up money working as a security guard then, starting in March, he began a meandering journey, by bus, hitchhiking and the occasional boat, through French Guiana, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and then Colombia.</p> <div class=\"bucketwrap image large\" id=\"res1045634277\">\n",

      "<p>The next morning, over campfire coffee, VivÃ³ joked that he made it through another night without getting attacked by snakes. Then he packed his gear and prepared to hit the trail once more. The NPR team had to return to Colombia's capital of BogotÃ¡, so VivÃ³ planned to join the next group of migrants that came along the trail. Traveling in numbers is key because it helps discourage gun-toting bandits who regularly rob migrants.</p> <p>Doctors Without Borders says that since May it has documented <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/rapes-of-u-s-bound-migrants-make-a-treacherous-route-even-more-dangerous-11630956539\">180 cases</a> of migrant women who have been raped in the DariÃ©n Gap. Panamanian authorities have recovered the remains of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/caribbean-panama-united-states-358e8ef8d1696c56ecf153c7fc9d709f\">50 migrants</a> who died while making the journey.</p> <p>Our guides gave VivÃ³ some last-minute tips on how to stay on the main trail and avoid getting lost. Then, after VivÃ³ promised to call us once in cellphone range on the Panamanian side, he wandered down the trail and disappeared.</p> <div class=\"bucketwrap image large\" id=\"res1045639156\">\n",
